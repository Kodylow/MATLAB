# Cryptography

This repository contains a MATLAB implementation of the Caesar and Vigenere Ciphers with a test suite to verify the correctness of the implemented cryptographic algorithms.

## Testing

To test the cryptographic algorithms implemented in this repository, follow these steps:

1. Unzip the repository and navigate to the root directory:

    ```bash
    unzip KodyLowMatlabHWCryptography.zip
    cd KodyLowMatlabHWCryptography
    ```

2. Open MATLAB and navigate to the `KodyLowMatlabHWCryptography` directory within the MATLAB command window:

    ```matlab
    cd /path/to/KodyLowMatlabHWCryptography
    ```

4. Run the `TestCiphers.m` file:

    ```matlab
    TestCiphers
    ```

    This will execute the test suite for the implemented cryptographic algorithms.

5. Review the test results in the MATLAB command window. It includes the examples listed in the powerpoint homework file.
